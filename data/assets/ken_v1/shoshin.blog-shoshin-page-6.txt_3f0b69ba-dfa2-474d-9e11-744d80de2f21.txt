I'm an industrial psychologist and software developer building AI-first ventures.

Previously, I led analytics at SpaceX, while exploring an ever-growing list of side quests alongside amazing scientists, engineers, and friends.

Shoshin (初心) is the zen buddhists term for beginner's mind. It is my reminder to embody humility and curiosity in everything I do.

This blog serves as a repository for some of my better ideas.
